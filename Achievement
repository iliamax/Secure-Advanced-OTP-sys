Here’s a summary of what we’ve achieved:

TOTP Generation: Secure OTP generation using TOTP with SHA-1 or SHA-256.
Push Notification: Secure OTP delivery via encrypted push notifications (FCM).
Encryption: Secure OTP secret storage using AES encryption.
OTP Expiration: Short OTP expiration window (30-60 seconds).
Key Rotation: Regular rotation of secret keys to avoid key exposure.
Rate Limiting & CAPTCHA: Protection against brute-force and bot attacks.
MFA: Combine OTP with other authentication factors to bolster security.
